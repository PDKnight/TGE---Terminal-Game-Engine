## What is it?
It's an engine for creating terminal-based games in web browsers.

## Instalation

2. Put it somewhere on your server (It has to be on server due to maps, which are written in PHP because of protection)
3. Change your `assets/config.js` file
4. Change your `assets/maps/your_map_name.php`
5. Change your `assets/maps/mapper.php` filename at the start of file to load the map you want.
