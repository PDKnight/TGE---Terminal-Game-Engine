## Instalation
1. Download zipped (.zip) version of repository
2. Put it somewhere on your server (It has to be on server due to maps, which are written in PHP because of protection)
3. Change your `example/assets/config.js` file
4. Run `example/index.html`
5. That's it! :)

This engine is also designed for making terminal-based games. All you need to make a game is in `game` folder. You have to do following:

1. Make your own map in `game/assets/maps/your_map_name.php` (tutorial on wiki)
2. Modify map path in `game/assets/maps/mapper.php` at the start of file to load your custom map.
